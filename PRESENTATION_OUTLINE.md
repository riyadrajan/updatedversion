## SLIDE 5: DETECTION TECHNOLOGY - PART 1 (2 minutes)
**Title:** Face Detection & Attention Metrics

**Content:**
**MediaPipe Face Mesh:**
- Detects 468 facial landmarks in real-time
- 30+ FPS performance

**Metrics Calculated:**
1. **EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)**

   - EAR < 0.21 = eyes closed

2. **Gaze Score**
   - Tracks where eyes are looking
   - Gaze > 0.2 = looking away

3. **Head Pose**
   - Pitch: up/down (-90° to +90°)
   - Yaw: left/right
   - Roll: tilt

**[PLACEHOLDER IMAGE: Face with MediaPipe landmarks overlaid]**

## SLIDE 12: FOCUS SCORE CALCULATION (1 minute)
**Title:** Quantifying Study Quality

**Content:**
**Formula:**
```
Focus Score = (1 - distracted_time / total_time) × 100
```

**Example Session (60 minutes):**
- Reading book: 40 min → Productive ✓
- Taking notes: 15 min → Productive ✓
- Phone usage: 3 min → Distracted ❌
- Drinking water: 2 min → Neutral ✓

**Calculation:**
```
Focus Score = (1 - 3/60) × 100 = 95%
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Measures quality, not just quantity
- Identifies improvement areas
- Motivates better study habits

**[PLACEHOLDER IMAGE: Focus score visualization with breakdown]**
